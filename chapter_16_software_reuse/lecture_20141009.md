#### Software Reuse

Application System Reuse: the whole application can be reused

Component Reuse:

**Benefits**
* increased dependibility
* reduced prodess risk
* effective use of specialists

**Design Patterns**
* reusing abstract knowlege about a problem
* makes use of object oriented characteristics
    * polymorphism
    * inheritance

* **Elements**
    * name
    * problem description
    * solution description

**Frameworks**
* individual subsytem used to build up a larger one
* larger entities that can be reused
* Framework Classes
        * System infrastructure framework
        * middleware integration framework
        * enterprise application framework

* Generator-Based Reuse
    * reuse of standard patterns and algorithms

* COTS product reuse
    * Commercial Off-The-Shelf Systems
    * faster application development and lower development costs

* Product Line Specialization
    * platform specialization
    * environment specialization
