#### Software Testing
* Testing shows that a program does what it is intended to do
* Test using artifical data
* can reveal the presence of errors but NOT their absence

##### Testing Goals
* demonstrate to the developer and customer that the software meets requiremnets
* discover situations in which the behavior is incorrect

#### Validation and Defect Testing
* Validation Testing - you expect the system to perform correctly using a set of test cases that reflect expected use
* Defect Testing - test cases are expected to show defects

#### Verification & Validation
* Verification: "are we building the right thing?"
* Validation: "are we building this the right way?"

#### V&V Confidence
1. Software Purpose
    - level of confidence depends on criticality of the software
2. User Expectations
    - users may have low expectations
3. Marketing Environment

#### Inspection and Testing
* **Software Inspections:** analysis of static verification (low level) source code testing
    * discover anomolies and defects
    * does not require execution of the system
    * effective for discovering program bugs

* **Software Testing:** testing the whole system (high level) system-wide testing

* Stages of Testing:
    * **Development testing** (Dev Team)
        * **Unit Testing**
            * testing individual classes -> methods
            * defect testing process
            * automated testing frameowrk (JUnit)
                * force the system to generate ALL error messages
                * cause input buffers to overflow
                * repeat input numerous times
                * force invalid outputs
                * force results to be too large or too small
    * **Component Testing**
        * check each software component separately
    * **Regression Testing**
        * checking older test results for completeness after making further changes
    * **System Testing**
        * testing of the integrated components that make up the whole system
        * easier done with automatic testing
    * **Release testing** (QA Team)
        * black box testing for the release team
    * **User testing** (User group)
        * given to user group for testing in a real-world environment
            * *Alpha Testing*
            * *Beta Testing*
            * *Acceptance Testing*
                * define criteria
                * does the customer accept the software product as is?

#### Key Points
* testing can only show presence of errors, it cannot demonstrate remaning faults
    * the responsibility of the dev team
    * Unit testing, component testing, system testing
