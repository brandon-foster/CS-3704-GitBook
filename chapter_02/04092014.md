### **Agile Methods**
- incremental development methods in which the increments are small and new releases of the system are made available to the customer frequently.

    ####Scrum
    * focused on managing iterative development

    ***3-Phases:***
        1. **Planning**
            * general objectives
            * design software architecture
        2. **Sprint Cycles** (fixed length: 2-4 weeks)
            * *Assess*
                * start with project backlog
                * assign priorities and risks
                * customer is involved
            * *Select*
                * dev team works with customer to select feature
            * *Develop*
                * dev team organizes themselves in isolation
                * scrum master goes through customer
                * short daily meetings
            * *Review*
                * work done in development is reviewed and presented to the customer
        3. **Project Closure**
            * complete required documentation
            * assess lessons learned from the project
    * **Advantages**
        * project is broken down into manageable chunks
        * unstable requirements do not hold up development
        * team visibility and communication is improved

#### Extreme Programming (XP)
* requirements expressed as “user stories”
stories are implemented as a series of tasks
small releases
* test-driven development process
* Devs work in pairs, checking each others work
constant refactoring of code
* incremental tasks are integrated into the system immediately following testing

#### Pair Programming
* dynamically paired
* pairs can change
* often working at the same desk/workstation

#### Validation & Verification (V&V)
**V&V Testing Stages**
1. **Development or Component Testing**
    * developers testing individual components
* **System Testing**
    * testing of integrated components
* **Acceptance Testing**
    * testing the system with real world data from the customer
    * continuous through the development process

#### Factors to consider in designing a process
* **Software Specification**
    * Defined functionality and constraints on its operation
* **Software Design & Implementation**
    * Design software to meet the specifications
* **Software Validation**
    * Ensure the software does what the customer wants
* **Software Evolution**
    * Software must evolve to meet changing customer needs

#### Agile Retrospective Meeting
* What did we do well/not well?
* Set goals for next retrospective meeting
* *NOTHING* is set in stone

**Process Activities** - defn:

####Requirements Engineering Process
(involve the dev team: Designers & Testers (QA))
* Feasibility study
* Requirements elicitation and analysis
* Software requirements specifications (SRS)
* Form : GoogleDoc, Sharepoint, Excel...
* Requirements validation
    * Are the requirements correct?
    * Do they reflect the needs and intents of the customer?

#### Architecture vs. Design
* **Architecture:** What to build?
* **Design:** How to build it?

#### Software Quality Attributes (SQA)
* Security
* Maintainability
* Modularity (High Cohesion, Low Coupling)

#### Design Activities
* Architectural design
* Interface design
* Component design
* Database design

#### Software Evolution
* Software is flexible and can change
* Allow for extension
* Maintainability is paramount

#### Continuous Integration
* Demands a mature team
* “go live” at any point during the day
* “automated testing” test suites
