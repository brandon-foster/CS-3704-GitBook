#### What is the Software Process?
* Verification: Is it right? Does it match the specifications?
* Validation: Does it match the customers needs and intents?

#### Why the Software Process?
* Answers many important questions:
    * Where are we in terms of completion?
    * Who is working on what?
    * Are we on time?
    * Are we within budget?

#### The General Software Process
    [Requirements] -> [Design] -> [Coding] -> [Testing] -> [Deployment]

#### The Plan Driven and Agile Processes
    (Discipline) <===> (Agility)
* both are equally important to maintain a successful project in both
* Agile is a “Mindset”

#### Prioritize Features
* Importance
* Difficulty
* Usefulness * recall the 80/20 Rule
* Changes WILL occur -> Constant Re-Prioritization

#### Prototyping Model
* **Pros**
    * Number of changes necessary may be reduced
* **Cons**
    * Might not look very good
    * Could give the customer a false sense of what the finished product will be

#### Spiral Model
* The only software development model that explicitly evaluates RISK
