# Midterm Study

* NO component based SE and software reuse chapters
* testing techniques
    * unit testing
    * component and system testing
    * alpha and beta testing
* architectural styles

#### Ch 1 : Introduction

* 4 P's of Software Engineering :
    * People (Who)
    * Process (How)
    * Project (Everything involved)
    * Product (What)

**IEEE Definition of Software Engineering :** the study and application of engineering to the design, development, and maintenance of software.

#### Architecture vs. Design
* Architecture
    * blueprint
    * high-level
* Design
    * how to do something
    * what to use
    * specifics

#### Ch 2 : Software Processes
* Steps
    * Specification
    * Design and Implementation
    * Validation
    * Evolution
* Plan Driven & Agile Processes

* Software Process
    * Process Framework
        * Umbrella Activities
            * Activities [1 - n]

* Software Process Models
    * Waterflow
        * Inflexible
        * Use for very large projects
    * Incremental Development
        * Rapid & Flexible
        * System tends to degrade as more is added
    * Prototyping Model
        * improved usability & dev. effort
        * compromises and unfinished work presented
    * ReUse Oriented SE
    * Spiral Model
        * Risk assesesed throughout w/ no fixed phases
        * requires risk mgmt expretise

#### Ch 3 : Agile software development

#### **The Agile Manifesto**
* *Individuals and Interactions* over *Processes and Tools*
* *Working Software* over *Comprehensive Documentation*
* *Customer Collaboration* over *Contract Negotiation*
* *Responding to Change* over *Following a Plan*
    * modify plans in order to accomidate change
* While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
