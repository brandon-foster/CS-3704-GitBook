## Agile Methods and Practices

#### SCRUM
**- Process Management Framework** <br>
**- Iteration and Incremental Development** <br>
**- does not specify software development techniques**

* **Product Backlog**
* **Effort Estimation**
<br><br>
* **Team Roles and Responsibilites**
    * Scrum Master *(Project Manager)*
        * ensures product is on time
        * manages the burndown chart
    * *Product Owner*
    * *Scrum Team*
        * Developers
        * Testers
    * *Customers*
    * *Executives (Management)*
* **Release Planning**
    * Product Backlog
        * User Stories
            *story points
* **Estimates**
    * use *"hours"* :* can be tedious*
    * better to estimate based on story complexity
    * a points based system of 1 or 2 days to a week
* **Sprint**
    * 2 - 4 weeks
    * using smaller Sprint Backlog
    * Burndown Chart
        * visibility of the Sprint
        * should be trending down to zero (completion)
            * slope == burndown velocity
            * calculate estimated completion date
            *   Work Remaining
* **Daily Scrum**
    * daily standup meeting (10 - 15 minutes)
* ** Sprint Review Meeting**
    * are we on time, do we need to change anything?
* **Sprint Retrospective Meeting**
    * What went well, what did not go well <br><br>

####Extreme Programming (XP)
* **4-Values**
    1. communication
    2. simplicity
    3. feedback
    4. couage
* **Pair Programming**
    * Two pairs of eyes on any line of code
    * helps to eliminate bugs
    * enforces styl guidlines
    * constant code review
* **Test-Driven Development**
    * tests written first
    * all subsequent code must pass the tests first
* **Collective Codebase**
    * increments are able to be released at *ANY* given time <br><br>

#### Feature Driven Developments (FDD)
1. Develop and overall model
    * based on requirements document
2. Build a features list
    * a list of features grouped into sets and subsequent areas
3. Plan a Feature
4. Design a Feature
5. Build a Feature
