#### Requirements Engineering

* Requirements are constantly changing

* Activities:
    * feasablity report
    * verification stage - confirmation
    * specification - recording requirements
    * ethnography -

* Tasks
    * for story *i*
        * Objectives
            * create tasks
        * Activities
            * preparation
            * elicitation
            * validations

* Advanatges of Agile RE
    * accomidates change late in the cycle

* Disadvantages of Agile RE
    * minimal process/decomposition of activites
    * non-functional requirements as not well-defined

* Estimation - the fine art of guessing
    * the cone of uncertainty
    * Is this project even possible?
    * Needs of estimations
        *
    1. Keep things simple
    2. Relative Sizing
        * size "stories" relatively to each other
    * unitless estimations (points)
    * ex: Login Page
        * sit down
        * ask questions
        * review mockups
        * go through with customer
            1. customer reads story
            2. team estimates
            3. 
            4.
