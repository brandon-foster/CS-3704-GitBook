#### Requirements Engineering

* **Specifications**
    * gather what the customer wants
    * un-ambiguous

* **Feasibility Study**
    * *can* and *should* this be build

* **Challanges**
    * changing requirements
        * biggest challenge
        * requirements *WILL* change over time

* **Concepts and Practices**
    * evolutionary requirements
    * minimal BIG requirements up front (BRUF)
    * incremental and iterative implementation of requirements
    * accomidate change late in the dev life cycle
    * minimal requirements documentation
    * Just-In-Time (JIT) requirements
    * implicit V&V
    * requirements -> priority stack
    * adopt stakeholder terminology
    * record requirements in user's vernacular
    * direct stakeholder involvement

* **Problem Formulation/Education**
* objectives
    * establish rapport among stakeholders
    * learn the business process of the customer
    * identify user classes

* **Features**
    * objectives
        * identify release-level features
        * prioritization of the identified features
    * activities
        * preparation
        * elicitation
        * validation and estimation
        * prioritization
    * output
        * prioritized features stack

* **Stories**
    * for a feature *i*
        * objectives
            * create user stories
            * prioritize the stories
        * activities
            * preparation
            * elicitation
            * validation and estimation
            * prioritization

* Priotitize Requirements
    1. Needs: Current
    2. Needs: Future
    3. Should Have
    4. Want to Have
    5. Nice To Have
