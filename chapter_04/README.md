# Chapter 04

#### Requirements Engineering

* the hardest part of a software engineering project
* the client is often confused on exactly what it is they want
* no other component cripples the system as much if done wrong

#### What is Requirements Engineering?
* the process of *'WHAT'* is to be done, ot be built
* analyze the problem
* documenting the observations
* check the accuracy of the understanding

#### Activities for New Product Reequirements Engineering
* legislative requirements
* legal requirements
* evaluate the risks to determine the rigidity of the requirements

#### What is a requirement?
* condition or capability required my the user to solve a problem
* can range from high-level to detailed mathematical functional specification

#### Types of Requirements
* Functional
    * input/process/output
    * what the system should do
* Non-Functional
    * performance, quality, interface, reliability
    * apply to the entire system
* Design Constraints
    * OS, Hardware, Software, Algorithms
* Implementation Constraints
    * algorithms, programming language
* User Requirement
    * stated in natural language
* System Requirements
* Domain Requirements
    * Scientific, Web, Gaming, Financial...
    * each domain has a specific set of requirements#

#### Requirements Engineering
* Elicitation
    * focus groups
    * business groups
    * discover, articulate and review
* Analysis
    * understanding the needs and constraints of the user
    * difference between 'customer' and 'user'
* Verification
    * are the standards adequate
* Specification
    * recording the requirements
    * document production
* Management
    * planning and controlling above activities
    * tools: 'Rational Roads'
    * effective process activities
    * sufficient process artifacts

#### Verification vs. Validation
* Verification
    * meets the system requirements
    * conforms to document standards
    * adequate basis for the design
* Validation:
    * are we on the right track?
    * validate with the customer
    * a part of each activity
    * **Criteria**
        * Validity
        * Consistency
        * Completeness
        * Realism/Feasibility
        * Verifiability

#### Goals and Requirements
* Goal:  ease of usability
* Domaing Requirements:
    * understandability
        * information may be lost in communicating this knowlege
    * implicitness
        * domain requirements must be specific
* Unambiguity
* Traceability
