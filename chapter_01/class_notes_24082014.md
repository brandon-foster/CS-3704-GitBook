**IEEE Definition of Software Engineering :** the study and application of engineering to the design, development, and maintenance of software.

#### Goals of Software Engineering
* quality on-time within budget value to customers and users

#### Objectives
* compromise
* trade-offs
* modularity --> low coupling

#### Principles
* // TODO

#### Attributes
* // TODO

#### Other Considerations
* **Users vs. Customers** Accommidate the plan ad-hoc (formed, arranged, or done for a particular purpose only.)

#### Process
* **communication** - who does what etc...
* **planning** - milestones, builds etc...
* **modeling**

    * high-level
* Design
    * how to do something
    * what to use
    * specifics

#### 80/20 Rule
* 80% of the features will be used 20% of the time
* 20% of the features will be used 80% of the time

#### Umbrella Activities
* activities spanning the entire development lifecycle
* Software Project Management
* Formal Technical Reviews
* Software Quality Assurance
* Software Configuration Management
* Re-usability Management
* Risk Management
* Measurement and Metrics
